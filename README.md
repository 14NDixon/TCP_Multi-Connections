# TCP_Multi-Connections
6/10/22
This is a repository for the TCP code to be used within the ULI Tech Demo. This code sends/recieves/manages the code from the FlightGear machine,
the GUI machine, and the server machine. Be sure to change the host addresses in both codes to be specific to your machine's IP address.
